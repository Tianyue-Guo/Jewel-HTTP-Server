This is one of my favorite rock musicians - Viktor Tsoi. 
He was a Soviet singer and songwriter and he co-founded Kino (one of the most influential bands).
He is regarded as one of the most important pioneers of Russian/Soviet rock. (cr. Wikipedia)

This picture is relevant to me because I really like his music. His songs empower me whenever I feel anxious and desperate.
